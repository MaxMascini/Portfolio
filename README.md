# Max Mascini's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that highlight my skills and interests across **neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), machine learning,** and **neurotechnology**. This repository showcases work from both my academic and independent projects, including contributions to Python-based libraries, EEG data analysis pipelines, and neuroadaptive technology experiments.
