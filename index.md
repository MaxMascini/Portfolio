## Max Mascini's Portfolio
### About Me
Hello, my name is Max and welcome to my coding and data manipulation portfolio!

I am an undergraduate student currently completing my BSc in Neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.
I am very interested in neurotechnology, brain-computer interfacing, machine learning, and classification. 
Currently, I am doing an independent project investigating different linear classifiers' performance using data collected with a novel hybrid BCI paradigm. The goal is to give general advice on the differences that well-known linear classification algorithms can have on performance across different stimulus conditions and participants to improve BCI performance moving forward.
